In order to use the project for yourself, you will have to perform the following steps:

1. Import the project into your Jubula database
2. In the AUT Configurations for MinifigCreator_Version1 and MinifigCreator_Version2, you should adapt the path to point to the place where you have installed the example AUT.

If you have not previously used Jubula, then you should consider working through the "First Steps" Cheat Sheet (available from the Help Menu) before commencing.
